A pair of positive integers (a,b) is called special if ⌊ab⌋=amodb. Here, ⌊ab⌋ is the result of the integer division between a and b, while amodb is its remainder.

You are given two integers x and y. Find the number of special pairs (a,b) such that 1≤a≤x and 1≤b≤y.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.

The only line of the description of each test case contains two integers x, y (1≤x,y≤109).

Output
For each test case print the answer on a single line.
